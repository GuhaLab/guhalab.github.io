I received my master degree of science in Biomedical Genetics from VIT (Vellore Institute of Technology) University, India in 2009. In 2010, I started my Ph.D. as a Marie Curie Fellow in Dr. Isabella Screpanti Lab at “La Sapienza” University of Rome, Italy, where I demonstrated the role of Notch3 regulated miRNAs in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. In 2014, I joined Dr. Pamela Stanley Lab in Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, USA, as a postdoctoral fellow, where I studied the role of Glycans in Notch Signaling and its effect on immune system development and function. After my postdoc tenure, I joined Shanghai Proton and Heavy Ion Centre (SPHIC), Shanghai, China, as Junior Principal Investigator, and in 2021, I was promoted to Principal Investigator. Here, we investigated the effects of conventional (X-rays) and particle radiotherapy on the signaling pathways and metabolism in cancer, with special emphasis on the Carbon ion irradiation (CIR) induced modulation of Notch signaling in glioblastoma (GBM) and pancreatic cancer. Our findings showed that CIR reduces Notch signaling in human glioma cells, which could have an impact on the therapeutic outcome of CIR. In 2023, I joined as an Instructor in Dr Chandan Guha's Lab, Radiation Oncology Dept, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, USA, where we are currently investigating the immuno-modulatory and mechano-modulatory effect of different modes of therapies such as X-ray, particle therapy and focused ultrasound in the treatment of cancer. 

My work in SPHIC was supported by Seed grant from SPHIC, Pudong New Area Science and Technology Development Grant, YYMMC Grant and RO1 Grant (Co-Investigator).

My long-term research interest is in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation (biochemical and biophysical) of the Notch signalling pathway and their role in tumorigenesis, cancer stem cells, response to different cancer treatment strategies, and how it might be targeted for therapeutic purposes. 

In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, cooking, reading history and science fiction books. I am a big fan of art, and music and love experimenting with different modes of painting.

Awards and Honors: Semester abroad programme (SAP) scholarship, Marie Curie Fellowship (European Union), Diploma in Space Science (St Joseph College and Indian Space Research Organisation).

Notable presentation: Invited talk in Gordon Research Conference (2016), VIT University (2021), AIMMSCR Amity University (2022), TCG-CREST (2023), New York Proton Consortium (NYPC) (2023).
