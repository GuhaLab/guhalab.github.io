Dr. Asp graduated from Stockholm University, Sweden, in 2004 with a thesis on ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling and gene regulation. He moved to New York in 2004 for his postdoctoral work, working with Dr. Brian Dynlacht at NYU where he was at the forefront of the massively parallel sequencing revolution. By combining RNAseq and ChIPseq he mapped the genetic and epigenetic regulatory networks that control and direct myogenic differentiation. In 2010, Dr. Asp joined the research group of Dr. Chandan Guha at the Albert Einstein of Medicine where he is responsible for the genetic, epigenetic and molecular biological work across multidisciplinary projects such as radiation injury of normal tissue, the use of energy therapies radiation and LOFU (low intensity ultrasound) on tumors and energy modulated tumor immunology.
