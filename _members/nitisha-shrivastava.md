Dr. Nitisha Shrivastava is a Ph.D. in Radiation Biology from University of Delhi and Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (DRDO) Delhi, India. She obtained her masters’ in Microbiology from India with recognition as a University topper (Gold medalist).

Dr. Shrivastava’s research is focused primarily on understanding the role of dormancy and senescence in cancer exploiting the 2D/3D in vitro models; and conditionally reprogrammed patient samples. Over the last few years her work has focused on establishing the role of senescence to synergize radiation response and limit tumorigenesis in various, but not limited to, head and neck; breast cancer etc. models. Dr. Shrivastava’s expertise lies in strategizing combinatorial therapies and comprehensively exploring key mechanisms and signaling pathways to intervene and enhance treatment responses. In recent years her work focused on utilizing radiation and ultrasound modalities in immortalized cell lines; organoids and animal models to understand and exploit the interplay between senescence and adaptive immune system with key focus on dendritic cells.

Dr. Shrivastava’s potential as a collaborative research player has been appreciated in <a href="https://einsteinmed.edu/news/4786/montefiore-einstein-cancer-center-researchers-receive-price-family-foundation-health-equity-research-awards/">progressing our institutes objectives.</a> Dr. Shrivastava has several publications in peer reviewed journals and international presentations underscoring her commitment to advancing the understanding of cancer mechanisms and therapeutic targets. Her work has also been recognized on various international and national forums since the beginning of her career, marking her excellence in the field. To name a few, Dr. Shrivastava has been awarded with the highly competitive and prestigious Scholar-in-training-Award by the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR), USA to recognize her as an outstanding young investigator. She has been winner of the proffered paper session in Head and Neck Society, NY, USA; awarded as an outstanding speaker for oral presentation in AECOM, NY, USA among several others. 

Dr. Shrivastava has mentored many juniors, and several rotation graduates and MD/PhD students in her tenure establishing her role of a successful team player and collaborative lab member as evidenced with her publications as second and third author etc. In addition, Dr. Shrivastava is an invited reviewer for many esteemed journals and publication houses; and dissertation thesis for Ph.D and masters' students. She has also actively participated in various non-academic forums and activities. 

Dr. Nitisha Shrivastava thrives to continue exploring potential treatment strategies circumventing tumor progression and metastatic relapse, and identify key signaling pathways and mechanisms.
