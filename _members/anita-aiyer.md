" Stem Cells and Regenerative medicine researcher with over a decade of experience in exploring 
 therapeutic potential in cell therapy and stem cell regeneration in the event of radiation insult. 

Cell transplantation therapies (such as: iPSC derived Hepatocyte like cells (iHeps), human intestinal organoids (iHIOs), bone marrow and patient derived Hu adipose mesenchymal cells) can be used as a treatment for radio-protection and mitigation of acute and chronic radiation injuries in normal tissue.

My areas of focus and expertise include:

• Generation of, 3D human intestinal organoids (iHIOs) from human iPSCs, adult mouse intestinal
   enteroids (mEnts) and Colon organoids (mCO) as an ex vivo model to screen radiomitigators. 
   demonstrated that transplantation of these organoids in DSS colitis and Radiation Proctitis (RP)
   mouse model to engrafted and propogated in injured mouse colon.

• Developed a Radiation Proctitis mouse model in the lab: a. to test small molecules and
  compounds such as hRspo1-fc as radiomitigators, and b. determine if transplantation of mouse 
  colonoids can alleviate inflammation and fibrosis in the proctitis induced animals

• Investigate if cells (mBM and/or human patient derived Mesenchymal Stem cells) and cell free
   therapy (Exosomes and Secretomes  from these cells) can be used as  potential therapies in
   whole body irradiation (WBI) and partial body irradiation (PBI) mouse model to mitigate radiation

• Transplanted hepatocyte like cells (iHep) derived from iPSCs in hepatic irradiated (HIR) animals to 
   replace depleted host hepatocytes and allow proliferation of engrafted iHep in the presence of a
   mitogen. 

• Presented Basic Science Abstract at the International Congress for Radiation Research Conference (ICRR) at Montral, Canada 2023 titled: “Recombinant Human Rspondin -1-Fc promotes crypt regeneration and alleviates inflammation in the rectum of mice with Radiation Proctitis	

• Oral presentation in Basic Science Awarded in the Biology category at the Annual Meeting 
Scientific Program Committee of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) 2013, titled, “Preparative Hepatic irradiation (HIR) for Transplantation of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC)-Derived Hepatocyte-Like Cells (iHep )in Mouse Livers”

• Presented Basic Science Abstract at American Society for Radiation Oncology 2013, titled “Human Induced Pluripotent stem Cells (iPSC) Derived Intestinal Organoids (iHIOs) to Screen Radiation Mitigators”

• Awarded First Prize for Einstein-Montefiore Young Research Investigators Symposium (2012) for “Preparative Hepatic irradiation (HIR) for Transplantation of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC)- derived Hepatocyte-Like Cell (iHep) in Mouse Livers”
