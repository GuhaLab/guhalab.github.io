My research focuses on the systemic immune effects of non-conventional radiotherapy and low-dose radiation across various cancer subtypes, with particular emphasis on modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) following stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Together with my team, we also develop novel therapeutic strategies to convert immune-tolerant tumors into immune-sensitive ones using alternate immunotherapy regimens, as well as epigenetic and metabolic modifiers.

During my PhD, I studied energy metabolism in tumor growth and chronic and acute inflammatory disorders. My research included exploring the effects of dietary interventions, specifically the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), on inflammation-induced cancers, as well as the bioenergetic targeting of inflammation-driven pathologies such as endotoxemia, obesity, and rheumatoid arthritis.
