Albert Einstein College of Medicine
Department of Radiation Oncology:

Focus:  Cellular immunity and tumor suppression
Project:  Investigating the anti-tumor potential of invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells against senescent cells within the 4T1 murine breast cancer model. This research aims to identify and characterize iNKT cell subpopulations capable of recognizing and eliminating senescent tumor cells, with the goal of developing novel immunotherapeutic strategies.

Department of Hepatology (Previous Research):

Hepatic immune response during hepatotropic Norway rat hepacivirus (NrHV) infection
Progression of liver disease using a novel mouse model for Hepatitis C vaccine development

Queen's Medical Research Institute, University of Edinburgh:
Marie Curie Research Fellowship:

Project: Characterization of novel adenoviral vectors for cardiovascular gene therapy (IAPP project)

Key Findings:

Investigated the potential of a newly isolated human adenovirus vector, AdV-20-42-42, for gene therapy and cancer vaccines.
Demonstrated the vector's ability to bind two key adenoviral receptors on human cells, suggesting its potential for targeted gene delivery.

University of Verona (PhD Research):

Focus: Overcoming resistance to viral oncolytic therapy in human cancers

Model Systems:

Human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) - solid tumor model
Multiple myeloma - hematological malignancy model
Project: Deciphering and manipulating signaling pathways that limit adenoviral infection in cancer cells.

Key Achievements:

Identified and silenced key pathways constitutively activated in cancer cells, leading to a significant increase in adenoviral vector (Ad5-GFP) infection efficiency.
Provided a foundation for future pre-clinical studies of oncolytic viral therapy.
