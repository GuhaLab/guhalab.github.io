I am a PhD student in the Guha Lab, co-mentored by Dr. Kosaku Shinoda in the Department of Molecular Pharmacology. My research focuses on radiation-induced metabolic dysfunction, with a particular emphasis on uncovering the molecular mechanisms that drive radiation-induced insulin resistance.

I graduated magna cum laude from Brandeis University in 2024 with dual bachelor's degrees in Biology and Health: Science, Society, and Policy. As an undergraduate, I conducted research in Dr. Susan Lovettâ€™s lab, where I investigated alternative DNA damage response pathways in E. coli. In recognition of this work, I was awarded the Dr. Frederick W. Alt '71 Research Grant for Molecular Genetics in 2023.

Outside the lab, I enjoy gardening, running, and discovering new corners of New York City with friends.
