Responsibilities  include managing a Siemens INVEON Multimodality PET/SPECT/CT scanner as a scientific core and all other radiation lab equipment, i.e. GM meters, well counters, and  dose calibrators; managing all aspects of operating a Nuclear Medicinal Laboratory; meeting with users to assist in reviewing and reprocessing data as it pertains to their experiments; performing scientific collaboration and billing through Ilab with  investigators;  meeting with NRC Agreement State Inspectors, AAALAC and Fire Inspectors; assisting the Onco-Physics Institute physicists with physics measurements, monthly QA (TPS, BB Test And Output Check) and small animal treatment with therapeutic x-rays; providing both physics and engineering support; performing minor repairs of laboratory equipment; assisting ultrasound physicists with applications of low frequency ultrasound equipment for preclinical applications; performing quality control;  training  users to operate an Xtrahl Irradiator, CT (SARRP, CIX-3) for imaging and treatment studies;  managing 3D printers - MakerBot Replicator2 and Dremel Digi lab 3D45, including printing/maintenance/repair and effectuating CAD design work for users; and mentoring and training medical students and college students in the use all related laboratory equipment. All equipment: Orthovoltage irradiators, ultrasound and PET/SPECT/CT are all being utilized together for experimental purposes. In addition, I have developed engineering prototypes, such as lead jigs and barrier containment holders complete with anesthesia delivery; modifications to improve the use of imaging devices, such as a limit switch; designed experiments with researchers interested in the use of the laboratory; designed and developed  new animal holders specific to ultrasound equipment, including a test fire instrument to ensure the instrument is properly working; and designed prototype devices, such as a vibrissae stimulator, which is listed on YouTube, for PET imaging.
