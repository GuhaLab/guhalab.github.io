I am a neuroscientist with expertise in systems neuroscience and translational research. During my five-year postdoctoral fellowship at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, I led projects investigating cerebellum-basal ganglia interactions using advanced techniques such as optogenetics, fiber photometry, and viral tracing. This work revealed both motor and non-motor roles of the cerebellum in cognitive and behavior. Currently, as an Instructor in Dr. Guhaâ€™s lab in the Department of Radiation Oncology at Einstein, I lead research focused on how radiation affects normal brain tissue. My work aims to uncover the mechanisms of radiation-induced neurotoxicity, identify biomarkers of injury and regeneration, and develop strategies to protect or restore brain function in patients undergoing radiotherapy
