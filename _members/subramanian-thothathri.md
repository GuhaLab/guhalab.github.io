I am a PhD student in Biomedical Sciences at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, working under Dr. Chandan Guha. I hold an MS in Infectious Diseases and Microbiology from the University of Pittsburgh and a B.Tech in Bioengineering from SASTRA University, India. My research experience includes roles at IGM Biosciences and Harpoon Therapeutics, focusing on T-cell activation and bioanalytical assays for cancer immunology. I have co-authored several publications and presented at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meetings. I have been honored with the Bob-Yee Scholarship and various poster competition awards. As a Project SHORT mentor, I guide prospective graduate students. Outside academia, I enjoy bouldering, playing violin, and participating in animal rescue and rehabilitation.
