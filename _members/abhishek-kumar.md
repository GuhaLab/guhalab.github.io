Dr. Abhishek Kumar is a biomedical scientist with a Ph.D. in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Delhi’s Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Center for Biomedical Research, where he specialized in advanced biopolymer applications for emergency trauma care. His doctoral research focused on developing natural biopolymer-based formulations, such as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.120186">alginate-derived hydrogels</a>, for rapid hemostatic control in trauma-induced hemorrhage, resulting in a patented technology currently undergoing <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.3c15048">animal clinical trials</a>. With expertise in virology, he contributed to the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2022.120411">development of 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose (2-DG)</a> at DRDO’s Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences, working in BSL-3 facilities to validate its broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. This research directly supported the Drug Controller General of India’s 2021 <a href="https://bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57139919">emergency approval</a> of 2-DG as an adjunct therapy for moderate-to-severe COVID-19 patients.

He is currently working as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Guha Lab. His research focuses on investigating sexual dimorphism in tissue repair and regeneration following x-ray irradiation. By utilizing advanced radiation exposure models, He aims to elucidate the distinct biological responses between males and females during post-radiation recovery, contributing to a deeper understanding of sex-specific mechanisms in radiation-induced damage and recovery.
