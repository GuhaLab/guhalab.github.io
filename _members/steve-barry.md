Dr. Barry serves as Director of Radiation Oncology Innovations at Montefiore Medical Center. At Montefiore Dr. Barry oversees the pre-clinical to clinical transition of medical technologies and research on combinations of modalities with radiation therapy, including the ultrasound energy-based cancer treatments to be developed herein. 
Dr. Barry has extensive  experience in the preclinical development of multiple biotechnology platforms and products. At Aduro Biotech, Dr. Barry managed and was directly responsible for magnetic nanoparticle manufacturing to ISO 13485 standards and was Principle Investigator for a \\$1M+ DoD contract to develop energy-based cancer treatments. Dr. Barry was the primary point of contact with regulatory consultants and the FDA, presented to CDRH at pre-IDE meeting, and was primary author of documents submitted to FDA in preparation for clinical development. 
Dr. Barry has worked closely with academic partners in advancing cancer therapies comprised of magnetic nanoparticles and radio-frequency (RF) magnetic field generators for cancer ablation and hyperthermia treatments into canine clinical trials. This work stems from product development at Aduro BioTech, where Dr. Barry served as VP of Strategic Development.  Aduro went on to leverage its immunology expertise to develop novel oncology and infectious disease products into an IPO and subsequent acquisition.  
At Alnis Biosciences, another biotechnology start-up, Dr. Barry developed nanoparticles comprised of chemotherapeutics and bimolecular targeting agents.  Dr. Barry served on the Board of Directors and was President during two rounds of financing led by the Johnson and Johnson Development Corporation.  Dr. Barry authored and was Principle Investigator of a multi-million dollar National Cancer Institute contract to develop magnetic nanoparticles for therapeutic & diagnostic applications.  Previously, Dr. Barry was CO-PI of a \\$1.5M National Cancer Institute contract supporting targeted chemotherapeutic delivery and was co-author and co-PI of a \\$3M DARPA grant that funded a nanotechnology-based Pathogen Countermeasures Program.
Dr. Barry has served in both Chairman and Reviewer capacities on National Institute of Health Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) review panels on nanotechnology and energy-based cancer therapeutic programs. Dr. Barry received his BS degree from the University of Texas at Austin and PhD from University of California, Berkeley, both in Chemical Engineering.
