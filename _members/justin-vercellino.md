I recently earned my Ph.D. in Biomedical Sciences at Albert Einstein College of Medicine with Dr. Chandan Guha. My thesis research involved collaborating with Janssen Pharmaceuticals primarily focusing on the development of thrombopoietin mimetic (TPOm) as a potent radio-mitigator of hematopoietic-ARS (<a href="https://stemcellres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13287-024-03734-z">published in Stem Cell Research & Therapy</a>). As I progress to a postdoctoral position funded by a diversity supplement under U01AI170032, I aim to delve deeper into the immune system, exploring radiation-induced immune dysfunction and bridging the gap between the hematopoietic and mature immune systems. Besides research, I enjoy hikes, hanging out with friends, and going to live shows.
